#It's not big data, and the semantic web isn't relevant*

For all our best efforts, library technology isn't exiting its MARC-based heritage with the spectacular saltation the majority of library technologists would like to see. Instead, it's slowly evolving into a space located not far from its current point of origin — the 1960s technologically — and the 1890s conceptually. 

In this talk, I claim that the real issue we're facing is not a technological one, but an inability to re-think our goals and processes in a way that makes libraries relevant in an increasingly technological world. We grasp after technologies as a solution to problems that stem from entirely non-technological causes. We focus on implementation details even though we really don't have a clue what we need to develop; we focus on the problems we have integrating MARC into an interconnected world and uncritically re-implement what the old MARC did in a new wrapper.

I argue that rather than attempting to overlay named technologies onto libraries, it is better to find out what needs to be done now with fresh eyes; the business analysts need to come to the fore and tell us what services our users need and how we need to present these services. The technological solutions to these needs are irrelevant outside the implementation.
