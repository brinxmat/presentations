#Round-tripping RDF: didn't we have a love-er-ly time

__Presenter:__ Rurik Thomas Greenall, Computas AS

__About the presenter(s):__ Rurik is a consultant and library technologist at Computas; he currently works at Oslo public library building a linked-data-based library platform.

__Intended audience:__ Library technologists with an interest in linked data and practical implementation in LMSes.

__Abstract:__ In this talk, I describe a simple, implemented method for round-tripping RDF via HTML/Javascript. The approach is outlined in clear terms and demonstrated to show how the method has been applied in a real-world application.

The talk is based on experience from building Oslo public library's new RDF-based library system and provides concise detail about a suggested approach for achieving round-tripping based on JSON-LD and LD-PATCH. 

I describe some of the issues associated with round-tripping and relate these to the implemented technique as well as show how some of the issues following implementation have manifested themselves in the cataloguing interface.

This is a technical talk aimed squarely at active implementers and those interested in developing innovative cataloguing interfaces.
