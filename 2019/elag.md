**Intended audience:** Programmers, IT managers

**Abstract:** 

We endeavour to present a coherent overview of how to develop and deploy applications using functions-as-a-service frameworks and generic managed services, showing how they add value, at the same time as describing potential pitfalls inherent in using these technologies in public cloud offerings.

Situating FaaS in the rest of the *aaS portfolio, we describe some recognizable trends in cloud migrations and development. Based on our experience creating services for a library consortium, we describe tooling and methods to ensure continuous, reliable, high-velocity deployment that can be used by even the smallest teams.
 
We argue that FaaS / Managed services strategies are useful in a number of contexts and should be evaluated when (re-)architecting cloud-based solutions.
