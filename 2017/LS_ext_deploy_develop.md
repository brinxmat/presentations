#Deploying and developing LS.ext

In 2016, Oslo public library went online with perhaps the world's first linked-data library system. 

In this workshop we get the system up and running, provide a local instance and set up the system for production; we learn hands on about docker, docker compose, deploying the entire system from source in a few minutes.

Once we have a system up and running, we look at the architecture and APIs, running briefly through coding standards and development set-up.

Finally, we create a simple dockerised search application or linked data endpoint.
