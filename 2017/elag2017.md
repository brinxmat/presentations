#Deploying an open-source platform for library services

In October 2016, Oslo public library deployed its new library services platform; in contrast to many other institutions, Oslo's system is not off-the-shelf software from a vendor, but a locally developed system.

In this talk, I cover how we have used sustainable open-source, local development in the library domain; I describe the technical platform, describing how container technology is used to make modular architecture a possible and show how existing software such as Koha has been used to provide services in the platform.

I will focus on our experiences with the use of linked data in the platform as a format for metadata, how we have have integrated this with traditional metadata workflows and where the next steps from our beginnings are headed.

I describe the ups-and-downs of system development with largely new technologies; what implementing linked data as the core format for bibliographic data really means and how we can move the shared metadata reality forward for all â€” irrespective of the systems in use.
