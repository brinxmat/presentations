#Vagrant-Docker development environment 

__Presenter:__ Rurik Thomas Greenall, Computas AS

__About the presenter(s):__ You know me

__Intended audience:__ Software developers

__Abstract:__ In this presentation, I will show how to set up and use a Vagrant-based development environment, covering basics such as installation and how to ensure that your development process is a quick as possible.

I present one way of developing with Docker that has proved useful in the projects I work on; this is not an in-depth introduction to Docker, but rather a methodology that can be used to remove the pain of development so that you can learn to build containers without having to experience the pain that many others experience.

The presentation includes the basics of both Vagrant and Docker, and provides a rationale for the use of both in development and Docker in production settings.
