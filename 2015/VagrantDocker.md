__Presenter:__ Rurik Thomas Greenall, Computas AS

__About the presenter(s):__ You know me

__Intended audience:__ Software developers

__Abstract:__ There's a lot of interest in containerisation, Docker is a container technology that is gaining traction. 

In this presentation, I will show how to set up and use a Vagrant-based development environment, covering basics such as installation and how to ensure that your development process is a quick as possible.

I present one way of using Docker that has proved useful in the projects I work on; this is not an in-depth introduction to Docker, but rather a methodology that can be used to remove the pain of development so that you can learn to build containers without having to experience the pain that many others experience,
