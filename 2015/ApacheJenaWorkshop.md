#Workshop: Using Apache Jena for those angry moments of actual development

Apache [Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) is an open source Java framework for the semantic web and linked data; in this workshop, we look at several aspects of the framework, including:

* The RDF API
..* Loading data
..* Creating RDF
..* Manipulating data
* Using the Fuseki triplestore
  * TDB: the Triple Data Base
  * Using the Fuseki triplestore
* Querying data with ARQ & SPARQL
  * Querying in-memory datamodels
  * Querying local triplestores
  * Querying remote triplestores
* Ontologies and inference
  * Building ontologies
  * Inferencing over datasets

This is a very hands-on workshop for developers used to Java development, but not RDF technology.

##Pre-requisites:

* Good understanding of Java
* Installed Java IDE
* Download and install the Maven project from [here](to be done)
