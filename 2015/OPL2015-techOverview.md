#Oslo public library's real-world challenges in migration from traditional ILS to RDF

Rurik Thomas Greenall, Computas AS.

In 2018, Oslo public library will move to its new premises in [Bj√∏rvika](http://blogg.deichman.no/nyedeichman/in-english/); at the same time, the library will roll out its new library system.

The library system is relatively unique in being created by the library staff from open source software with a view to being an independent platform for library services. In fact, the concept of the system is as far away from a traditional integrated library management system as possible, with a linked data core and modular design.

This talk is about the (anno 2015) development of the system, development methodologies, the software stack, how we're taking Koha as a tool for everyday management tasks, linked data for cataloguing, and REST services to provide interfaces for the systems the data.
