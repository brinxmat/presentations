## Abstract
One of the major issues facing various projects that the author has been involved in has been the management of linked data represented as RDF. In this presentation, I outline some problematic aspects of persisting managed linked data as RDF and some methods of alleviating these. I look at apporaches that have been taken in several projects and contrast these with non-RDF data management. Further, I suggest alternative approaches to providing best-of-both worlds approaches that allow the application of traditional data management techniques to semantic data at the same time as providing linked data in RDF and other serialisation via HTTP and SPARQL.
